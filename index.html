			I practise horse-riding for now 8 years and I can tell it's more than a hobbi for me, it's a passion. I really enjoyed sing and cooking too. Doing this activities, I feel more connected to myself and happier.	These three passions are the pillars of my happiness and personal fulfillment. ‚òÑÔ∏è

		<h2>Sing üé§</h2>
		    <p>
		    	I am passionate about singing since I'm little. It's like a breath of fresh air for my soul every time I sing. It's my sanctuary, my release, and my endless source of joy. When I sing, I feel like I'm truly alive and connecting with the deepest parts of myself.

		<h2>Cooking üë®‚Äçüç≥</h2>
		    <p>
		    	My family and I share a deep affection for cooking because it's our way of coming together, creating memories, and showing our love. Preparing and enjoying meals as a family creates a special harmony between us, especially with my father. I love exploring new recipes, mixing flavors, and creating delicious dishes for them.

		<h2>Horse riding üêé</h2>
		    <p>
		    	My first passion is horse riding, it's like experiencing a freedom in harmony with nature. I devoted eight years of my life to riding, developing a deep connection with horses. After so much time, I feel like a fish in water in this sport. I hope I will have the chance to continue practising it in my life, even if it's expensive.
